noot
=============

Noot Language and Compiler. This is me experimenting with programming language design. The compiler will compile Noot to TAM (Triangle Abstract Machine) using a compiler that has been generated by Antlr3 out of an Antlr grammer.

Usage
-------------

To run the compiler enter ```java -jar NootCompiler.jar examples/example.nt```. You should always enter a file with a ```.nt``` extention. This will automaticlly generate ```.as```, ```.dot``` and ```.tam``` files. The ```.as``` you could examine the generated TAM instructions. The ```.dot``` is a visual representation of the AST. And the ```.tam``` is a file you can put into the TAM Interpreter. After compilation the program is automaticlly executed.

To execute a compiled program again use ```java -jar TAMInterpreter.jar examples/example.tam```.

Code examples
-------------

Simple read, calculate and print example:

```
noot

int a, b, c, d;

a := b := 4;
c := b + 3 * 2;

read(d);
print(d + c);
```

Example by using compound expressions. The result of the last expression  before the closing curly bracket will fill a.

```
noot

bool a;

a := {
		int h,i;
		read(h,i);
		(h > i);
	};
```

Using a coumpound expression in an if statement.

```
noot

bool a;
const bool b := true;

a := if b == true then {
		int i,j;
		j := 5;
		(j > i);
	}
else
	false
fi;

print(a); // comment, this will print true
```

Using a while loop.

```
noot

bool a;
int b;

a := true;
b := 0;

while a == true do {
	b := b + 1;
	print(b);
	if b > 10 then { a := false; } fi;
} od;
```

Dot files
-------------

The generated dot files can be opened with [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

TAM was developed by David A Watt & Deryck F Brown as educational tool for their book [Programming Language Processors in Java](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~daw/books/PLPJ/).

The TAM Assembler was developed by Matthijs Bomhoff from the University of Twente.
